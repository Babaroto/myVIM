# VIM CONFIG
This is the .vimrc configuration of my VIM editor

I mostly use VIM for HTML, CSS and Python, but this vim have a few plugins to make all the "experience" navigate through files more easy like:

* **NERDTree**
* **FileFuzzy**
* **Coc**

Beside this .vimrc file have a few set and keymap shortcut that save time to execute some comands like save, close, quit, etc. This file have some skin to make more comfortable to see using some *Gruvbox* commands

The terminal that use for access the text editor is [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). And the plug manager is [VimPlug] (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
